To achieve this, you can use a combination of Java, Cassandra for persistence, and a UUID generation mechanism. Here’s a structured approach:

	1.	UUID Generation:
	•	Use Java’s UUID class to generate unique identifiers.
	2.	Pagination and UUID Retention:
	•	Store UUIDs in Cassandra or a temporary in-memory data structure to ensure that they are retained across pagination.
	3.	API Call for New Transactions:
	•	When you navigate to the next page and there are no records in Cassandra, make an API call to fetch new transaction records and generate UUIDs for them.

Here’s a high-level implementation:

Step 1: Define the Transaction

 Class
import java.util.UUID;

public class Transaction {
    private UUID uuid;
    private String details; // Other transaction details

    public Transaction(String details) {
        this.uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
        this.details = details;
    }

    public UUID getUuid() {
        return uuid;
    }

    public String getDetails() {
        return details;
    }

    public void setDetails(String details) {
        this.details = Step 2: UUID Retention and Pagination

To retain UUIDs across pagination, you can use a map to store the page number and the list of transactions.


To achieve this, you can use a combination of Java, Cassandra for persistence, and a UUID generation mechanism. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **UUID Generation**:
   - Use Java's `UUID` class to generate unique identifiers.

2. **Pagination and UUID Retention**:
   - Store UUIDs in Cassandra or a temporary in-memory data structure to ensure that they are retained across pagination.

3. **API Call for New Transactions**:
   - When you navigate to the next page and there are no records in Cassandra, make an API call to fetch new transaction records and generate UUIDs for them.

Here’s a high-level implementation:

### Step 1: Define the Transaction Class
```java
import java.util.UUID;

public class Transaction {
    private UUID uuid;
    private String details; // Other transaction details

    public Transaction(String details) {
        this.uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
        this.details = details;
    }

    public UUID getUuid() {
        return uuid;
    }

    public String getDetails() {
        return details;
    }

    public void setDetails(String details) {
        this.details = details;
    }
}
```

### Step 2: UUID Retention and Pagination
To retain UUIDs across pagination, you can use a map to store the page number and the list of transactions.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TransactionService {
    private Map<Integer, List<Transaction>> transactionPages = new HashMap<>();
    private static final int PAGE_SIZE = 10;

    // Simulate a database fetch from Cassandra
    private List<Transaction> fetchFromDatabase(int pageNumber) {
        // Your code to fetch transactions from Cassandra
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }

    // Simulate an API call to fetch new transactions
    private List<Transaction> fetchFromApi() {
        // Your code to fetch new transactions from an API
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public List<Transaction> getTransactions(int pageNumber) {
        if (transactionPages.containsKey(pageNumber)) {
            return transactionPages.get(pageNumber);
        }

        List<Transaction> transactions = fetchFromDatabase(pageNumber);
        if (transactions.isEmpty()) {
            transactions = fetchFromApi();
            // Generate UUID for new transactions and store in Cassandra if needed
            for (Transaction transaction : transactions) {
                // Store transaction in Cassandra
            }
        }

        transactionPages.put(pageNumber, transactions);
        return transactions;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Pagination Logic
Implement logic to navigate between pages.

```java
public class Pagination {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TransactionService transactionService = new TransactionService();

        // Fetch transactions for page 1
        List<Transaction> page1Transactions = transactionService.getTransactions(1);
        // Display transactions or handle them as needed

        // Fetch transactions for the next page
        List<Transaction> page2Transactions = transactionService.getTransactions(2);
        // Display transactions or handle them as needed

        // Fetch transactions for the previous page
        List<Transaction> previousPageTransactions = transactionService.getTransactions(1);
        // Display transactions or handle them as needed
    }
}
```

### Notes
1. **Cassandra Persistence**: Ensure that transactions fetched from the API are stored in Cassandra with their UUIDs if they need to be persistent.
2. **Thread Safety**: If your application is multi-threaded, ensure that access to `transactionPages` is thread-safe.
3. **API Calls**: Handle the logic for making API calls, including handling errors and retries.

This setup will ensure that UUIDs are retained for transactions across pagination and new UUIDs are generated for new transaction records as needed.
